PTR records are working only for IPv4, IPv6 reverse is not implemeted.

When IPv4 or IPv6 is given with argument q, my program attempts to get its hostname so that it can get DNS records. Might be considered a feature or unwanted behaviour, as this is done with getnameinfo() function. This behaviour is unwanted, it can be disabled with option -o

some whois servers might not produce any output if they do not match regular expression

asks whois server about up to 10 A records and up to 10 AAAA records
